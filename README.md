# Friend-Finder

## Description

Friend Finder is a friend matching app that matches users to similiar people based on their answers to ten survey questions. The answers range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, an existing person with the closest absolute score of the ten questions combined, is matched with the user.

Friend Finder utilizes Node.js and Express on the backend with a Bootstrap frontend framework.
